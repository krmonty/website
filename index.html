		<h1>My name is Kaylee!</h1>
		<h2>I love photography.</h2 >
		<p>I plan to have a career in Graphic Design after I graduate. This is where I will be sharing my photography with you!</p>
		<p>What got me into photography and graphic design was my love for being in yearbook in high school.</p>
		<p>I took that love and turned it into a major and something I want to learn more about and do it for the rest of my life.</p>
		<h2>Maybe I will start my own business someday!</h2>
		<p>I could use my photography to make cards or inspirational art.</p>
