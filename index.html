		<h1 style="font-family:helvetica;">My name is Kaylee!</h1>
		<h2 style="color:purple;">I love photography.</h2 >
		<p style="font-family:helvetica;">I plan to have a career in Graphic Design after I graduate. This is where I will be sharing my photography with you!</p>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica;">What got me into photography and graphic design was my love for being in yearbook in high school.</p>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica;">I took that love and turned it into a major and something I want to learn more about and do it for the rest of my life.</p>
		<h2 style="color:purple;">Maybe I will start my own business someday!</h2>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica;">I could use my photography to make cards or inspirational art. Right now I use my skills for the yearbook staff at GU.</p>
		<br/>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica;">Some things that I like to take pictures of include:</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li style="font-family:helvetica;">Animals</li>
			<li style="font-family:helvetica;">Sports</li>
			<li style="font-family:helvetica;">Friends and family</li>
			<li style="font-family:helvetica;">Portraits</li>
		<h2 style="color:purple;">Below is some of the work that I have done :)</h2>
